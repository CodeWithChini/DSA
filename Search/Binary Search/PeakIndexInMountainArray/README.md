<h1>Peak Index In Mountain Array</h1>

You are given an integer mountain array arr of length n where the values increase to a peak element and then decrease.
<br>
Return the index of the peak element.
<br>
Your task is to solve it in O(log(n)) time complexity.
<br>


<h3>Example 1:</h3>

Input: arr = [0,1,0]<br>

Output: 1<br>

<h3>Example 2:</h3>

Input: arr = [0,2,1,0]<br>

Output: 1<br>

<h3>Example 3:</h3>

Input: arr = [0,10,5,2]<br>

Output: 1<br>

<h3>Constraints:</h3>

3 <= arr.length <= 105 <br>
0 <= arr[i] <= 106 <br>
arr is guaranteed to be a mountain array. <br>
