<h1>Peak Index In Mountain Array</h1>

You are given an integer mountain array arr of length n where the values increase to a peak element and then decrease.
<br>
Return the index of the peak element.
<br>
Your task is to solve it in O(log(n)) time complexity.
<br>


<h3>Example 1:</h3>

Input: arr = [0,1,0]<br>

Output: 1<br>

<h3>Example 2:</h3>

Input: arr = [0,2,1,0]<br>

Output: 1<br>

<h3>Example 3:</h3>

Input: arr = [0,10,5,2]<br>

Output: 1<br>

<h3>Constraints:</h3>

3 <= arr.length <= 105 <br>
0 <= arr[i] <= 106 <br>
arr is guaranteed to be a mountain array. <br>

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
<br>
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
<br>
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
<br>
<b>Notice</b> that you may not slant the container.

<h3>Example 1:</h3>

Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]<br>
Output: 49<br>
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case,<br> the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.<br>

<h3>Example 2:</h3>

Input: height = [1,1]<br>
Output: 1<br>
<h3>Constraints:</h3>

n == height.length<br>
2 <= n <= 105<br>
0 <= height[i] <= 104
