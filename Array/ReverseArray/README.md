<h1>Reverse Array</h1>
You are given an array of integers arr[]. You have to reverse the given array.
<br>
Note: Modify the array in place.
<br>
<br>

<h3>Example 1:</h3><br>
Input: arr = [1, 4, 3, 2, 6, 5]<br>
Output: [5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 1]<br>
Explanation: The elements of the array are [1, 4, 3, 2, 6, 5]. After reversing the <br>array, the first element goes to the last position, the second element goes to the <br>second last position and so on. Hence, the answer is [5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 1].<br>

<h3>Example 2:</h3><br>
Input: arr = [4, 5, 2]<br>
Output: [2, 5, 4]<br>
Explanation: The elements of the array are [4, 5, 2]. The reversed array will be [2, 5, 4].<br>
<br>
<h3>Example 3:</h3>
Input: arr = [1]<br>
Output: [1]<br>
Explanation: The array has only single element, hence the reversed array is same as the original.<br>
<h3>Constraints:</h3>
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
<br>
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 105
<br>
