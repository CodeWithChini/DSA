<h1>Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock</h1>

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
<br>
You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.



<h3>Example 1:</h3>

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]<br>
Output: 5 <br>
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.<br>
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
<br><br>
<h3>Example 2:</h3>

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]<br>
Output: 0<br>
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
<br><br>
<h3>Constraints:</h3>

1 <= prices.length <= 105<br>
0 <= prices[i] <= 104
<br><br>
