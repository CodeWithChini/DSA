<h1>Container With Most Water</h1>

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
<br>
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
<br>
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
<br>
<b>Notice</b> that you may not slant the container.

<h3>Example 1:</h3>

Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]<br>
Output: 49<br>
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case,<br> the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.<br>

<h3>Example 2:</h3>

Input: height = [1,1]<br>
Output: 1<br>
<h3>Constraints:</h3>

n == height.length<br>
2 <= n <= 105<br>
0 <= height[i] <= 104
<br><br>
